                Its chief claim to fame is that it was the early 
                administrative centre established by the British Government 
                for the 1820 British Settlers who were sent to the district 
                as a buffer between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa pastoralists 
                who were migrating southwards and westwards along the coast.
                Bathurst is now part of the Ndlambe Local Municipality 
                in the Sarah Baartman District Municipality of the Eastern Cape.

                and there remains much of the look and feel of an English village of the early 19th century.
                The Pig and Whistle Inn, at the heart of the village, is reputedly the oldest extant pub in the country, 
                built in 1821 by Thomas Hartley, a blacksmith who came from Nottinghamshire with the settlers. 
                After accommodation was added to the put it became known as the Bathurst Inn.
                Legend has it that it was nicknamed "The Pig & Whistle" by the men at the nearby 43 Air School in World War II.
