<p class="pigandwhistle">

    The Inn has been providing hospitality to local 
    and international travellers for almost 200 years, 
    and is home to the oldest continuously
    licensed pub in the country. An atmosphere of 
    heartfelt hospitality permeates the pub,
    accommodation and restaurant,as does a sense of the original 
     1820 settler history.

<p class="museum">
    In 1970, Shirley Hounsel formed a working committee to establish an Agricultural Museum in Bathurst, Eastern Cape.
    Temporary accommodation was provided by the Bathurst Agricultural Society and volunteers collected suitable items.
    In 1978, the first building was erected, later named the "Geoff Palmer Hall". In 1981, an addition of 60ft was built and completed. 
    The collection has grown rapidly and now has over 1 900 items,
    many of which are rare and unique. In 1988, the "HH Norton Shed" was re-erected on its present site and known as the "Stationery Engine Room".
