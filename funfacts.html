        <p class="funfacts">

    Although it is mostly a copy of the Big Pineapple located in Queensland, Australia, 
    <br>the Big Pineapple in Bathurst is taller by just over two feet and thus is
    the World's Largest Pineapple.<br>The structure has four floors, including a gift shop 
    with a variety of pineapple products, a museum covering <br> the history of pineapple 
    farming in South Africa, a video room, and an observation deck with views over 
    the <br> surrounding farmlands to the Indian Ocean. The “skin” of the Big Pineapple is
    steel and concrete, covered in <br> glass fibre. Bathurst hosts a pineapple museum whose building is 
    shaped like a 17 metres (56 ft) tall pineapple.<br> The museum is in the agricultural town of Bathurst, a town known as pineapple country, 
    on a pineapple farm <br> known as Summerhill Pineapple Farm.

     A circular toposcope is located on a lookout point near village.
     It was constructed around the original stone beacon from which many 1820 settlers were shown their allotments of land. 
     <br>Inlaid in the toposcope are 57 bronze plaques recording details of each settler party.
